# CNCF Project Maturity Levels

Version: 0.1.0
Status: Draft
Style Guide: style-guide--versioned-documents-in-unrendered-markdown

## Purpose

This document explains the Cloud Native Computing Foundation's three project maturity levels. It is reference material for use when evaluating CNCF-hosted tools on the uc-radar, specifically when assessing the Longevity and Market Position metrics under the Universal Cake Evaluation Metrics. A tool's CNCF maturity level is a governance signal, not a quality rating, it tells you about project health, contributor diversity, and resilience to single-vendor capture.

## What CNCF is

CNCF (Cloud Native Computing Foundation) is a vendor-neutral foundation under the Linux Foundation that hosts and governs open source projects in the cloud native infrastructure space. Kubernetes is the most well-known CNCF project.

## Maturity levels

CNCF has three maturity levels for hosted projects.

**Sandbox**, early-stage projects that the CNCF considers interesting and worth nurturing. Low bar for entry. No guarantee of production readiness or long-term sustainability. For radar purposes, treat Sandbox status as "the CNCF is watching this," not as an endorsement of readiness.

**Incubating**, projects that have demonstrated growth, a healthy contributor base, adoption by multiple organisations in production, and a governance structure that is not dependent on a single vendor. The project has passed a due diligence process. For radar purposes, Incubating status is a meaningful signal of project health and longevity, it means the CNCF has formally recognised the project as serious and production-used, with multi-vendor governance.

**Graduated**, the highest level. Projects that have reached broad production adoption, a mature governance model, and a demonstrated commitment to long-term sustainability. Kubernetes, Prometheus, Envoy, and Fluentd are examples. For radar purposes, Graduated status is the strongest available third-party governance signal for a cloud native tool.

## Relevance to Universal Cake Evaluation Metrics

A CNCF maturity level is relevant to two metrics areas.

Under **Longevity**, foundation governance is more resilient to key-contributor departure or commercial acquisition than single-company governance. A project under CNCF is not dependent on any one company's continued interest.

Under **Market Position**, specifically forkability and contributor concentration, CNCF governance ensures that no single vendor controls merge authority or project direction. This is a structural check on the power-imbalance proxies the metrics document asks about.

CNCF status does not substitute for the other metrics. A Graduated project can still fail on exit/portability, accessibility, or sovereignty. The maturity level tells you about governance, not about the product itself.
